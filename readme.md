## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Python** 3.7+
- **WireGuard** (Automatically installed by script)
- Administrator privileges to run installation script

## üîß Installation (Recommended)

### 1. Download the PowerShell Installer

Download `Install-ckart.ps1` from the [Releases](https://github.com/ProjectIndra/Indra-cli/releases) section of this repository.

### 2. Run in PowerShell (as Administrator)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Install-ckart.ps1
````

This will:

* Install WireGuard (if not present)
* Install the CLI from GitHub

WIREGUARD_EXE=C:\Program Files\WireGuard\wireguard.exe
CONFIG_PATH=C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\new-client.conf
CONFIG_NAME=new-client
CKART_SESSION=<automatically set on auth>
```

## üî• Firewall Rules (Optional for Some Systems)

Run the following commands in **PowerShell as Admin** to allow WireGuard traffic:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow WireGuard" -Direction Inbound -InterfaceAlias "new-client" -Action Allow
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow ICMPv4" protocol=icmpv4 dir=in action=allow
```
